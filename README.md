# Minimal Blackchain with Python
 
A  blockchain, originally  block chain,  is a growing list of  records called  blocks, that are linked using  cryptography. Each block contains a  cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp "Trusted timestamping", and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of its data. This is because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks.

For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a  peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered  secure by designand exemplify a distributed computing system with high  Byzantine fault tolerance. The blockchain has been described as "an open,  distributed ledger  that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".
